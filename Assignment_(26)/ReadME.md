1.Chess:Using the numpy and cv2 libraries, this code creates an 80x80 pixel image similar to an 8x8 chessboard. Each square of the chessboard is 10 x 10 pixels, and the white and black squares are arranged alternately.

2.Invert:This code reads two images from the specified path, reverses the color of each pixel (white to black and vice versa).

Input:

![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/632ec942-23c8-4b8f-ad44-e0a3f4b45f33)

Output:

![invert_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae329db3-e53a-4d25-9f07-3e6c74b81127)

3.Rotate:This code rotates the image 180 degrees.

4.Name:In this code, the letter "y" is displayed with black pixels on a white screen.

5.Gradient:This code creates a 255x255 pixel image with a vertical grayscale gradient that changes from white (255) to black (0). Each row of the image becomes progressively darker and the final image is saved as "gradient.jpg".

6.Face:This code reads an image called "face.jpg", converts it to grayscale, and then applies a pattern of horizontal and diagonal black lines to the grayscale image.
